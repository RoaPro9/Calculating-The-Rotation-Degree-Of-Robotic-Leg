# Calculating-The-Rotation-Degree-Of-Robotic-Leg
The Robotic leg position in this case forms a right scalene triangle.
### What is a Right Scalene Triangle?
A right scalene triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are different in length and one angle is equal to 90 degrees. A triangle is a closed figure made up of three lines and three angles. There are different types of triangles based on the side lengths and angles like a right triangle, scalene triangle, equilateral triangle, etc. A right scalene triangle is one such type of triangle that contains the properties of a right triangle and a scalene triangle.

### The Robotic Leg Rotaton:
#### Using the measure tool in Blender.

here is an approximation measurements:

here is a exact  measurements:

#### Using the Cossincalc calculator.
based on this calculation the Robotic leg can rotate 22.2Â° degree.
